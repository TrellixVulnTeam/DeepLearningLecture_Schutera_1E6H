    "## Introduction\n",
    "In this tutorial, you will attempt to implement a Generative Adversarial Neural Network for image generation on the MNIST dataset. Labeled training data is the fuel for supervised machine learning approaches. Thus GANs can be seen as the holy grail when it comes to generating additional data affiliated with a given source domain. GANs have first been introduced by [Goodfellow et al.](http://arxiv.org/abs/1406.2661)\n",

    "GANs are based on a joint training of at least two separate neural networks. The generator and the discriminator.\n",
    "The generator takes an input, most often a latent random input, and maps this input to an output with the dimensions of a source domain sample, meaning real-world data. The discriminator takes inputs from either the source domain or the generator. The discriminator then does a binary classification, learning to distinguish between generated and real samples.\n",

    "The training process happens in two passes. During the first pass the generator is frozen, and the discriminator is trained to distinguish between real and generated samples. \n",
    "In the second pass, the discriminator is frozen and the generator is trained using the discriminator classification as objective, backpropagating the error. \n",
    "By iteratively repeating those two passes, the quality of the generated samples increases, while the ability of the discriminator of distinguishing between real and generated improves too.\n"
